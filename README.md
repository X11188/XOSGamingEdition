Absolutely **__DO NOT__** install this without a backup. Although it may work on my machine and many other's, there is a possibility it wont work on your machine.
Note that I am also not responsible to any damage to your computer.
**You have been warned.**

# **Why?**

This was made simply because I don't like how Windows comes "bloated" by default.
There are many tweaks that I've tested to allow for more performance and less latency.
It has the drawback of being a little less compatible, I can't test everything in the world so... Gl if u use it.

# **How can I check the list of tweaks and deleted files?**
Simply check the batch files to see the list of currently deleted items(there is alot, lol). Check the reg file for current tweaks.

This is purely for me and some of my friends, I won't even credit that I made it. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to your heart's content :D
