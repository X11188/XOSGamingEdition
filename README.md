Absolutely do not install this without a backup. Although it may work on my machine and many other's, there is a possibility it wont work on your machine.
You have been warned.

**Why?**

This was made simply because I don't like how Windows comes "bloated" by default.
There are many tweaks that I've tested to allow for more performance and less latency.
It has the drawback of being a little less compatible, I can't test everything in the world so gl if u use it.

Simply check the XOSGaming.bat file to see the list of currently deleted items(there is alot, lol).
Check the XOSGaming.reg file to see the list of current tweaks.
Check the WindowsPE.bat file to see the list of currently deleted items for WindowsSetup.

This is purely for me and some of my friends, I won't even credit that I made it. Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v to your heart's content :D
